Been reading up on Smart Contract Security for the last couple of days and found it really interesting. 
I'm passionate about Web3 adoption and to become widely adopted, we need to make sure our smart contracts are secure.
For me, learning how to audit contracts is my way of contributing to the ecosystem and simultaneously learning DeFi properly.
Maybe one day I'll be able to create my own cool protocol from the knowledge I have gained :)

Created a codearena account and found some resources on how to get started with auditing contracts.

Hopped onto codearena to check out the current Rubicon competition.
Still way behind in understanding solidity but found a potential gas optimisation.
Need to understand the tooling better (foundry / slither).
Also want to go through the secureum youtube channel and do some Capture The Ether challenges.
