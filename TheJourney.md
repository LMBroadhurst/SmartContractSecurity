Been reading up on Smart Contract Security for the last couple of days and found it really interesting. 
I'm passionate about Web3 adoption and to become widely adopted, we need to make sure our smart contracts are secure.
For me, learning how to audit contracts is my way of contributing to the ecosystem and simultaneously learning DeFi properly.
Maybe one day I'll be able to create my own cool protocol from the knowledge I have gained :)

Created a codearena account and found some resources on how to get started with auditing contracts.

Hopped onto codearena to check out the current Rubicon competition.
Still way behind in understanding solidity but found a potential gas optimisation.
Need to understand the tooling better (foundry / slither).
Also want to go through the secureum youtube channel and do some Capture The Ether challenges.

Submitted some gas reports and QA for caviar competition.
Probably didn't catch anything but just a punt from some work with chat GPT.

Away until 12/04/23.

Looking at modifiers and how they can be used to improve security.
Going through the basics with Ethernaut and looking at the frankencoin competition.

Completed up to L7 in Ethernaut.

Realised how much harder this is going to be that I initially thought.
Need to take it slower, there's a lot to learn and so much I don't know.
People saying they found mid/high level bugs in the first month etc probably outliers or chatting waffle.
