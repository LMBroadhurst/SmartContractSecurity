# Uniswap
The Uniswap protocol uses an Automated Market Maker (AMM), sometimes referred to as a Constant Function Market Maker, in place of a traditional order book.

An AMM replaces the buy and sell orders in an order book market with a liquidity pool of two assets, both valued relative to each other. As one asset is traded for the other, the relative prices of the two assets shift, and a new market rate for both is determined.
