## Swaps
At the most basic level, all swaps in Uniswap V2 happen within a single function, aptly named swap:

`function swap(uint amount0Out, uint amount1Out, address to, bytes calldata data);`

## Pools
Each Uniswap liquidity pool is a trading venue for a pair of ERC20 tokens.

Uniswap is unique in that it doesnâ€™t use an order book to derive the price of an asset or to match buyers and sellers of tokens. Instead, Uniswap uses what are called Liquidity Pools.

### Pool Tokens
Whenever liquidity is deposited into a pool, unique tokens known as liquidity tokens are minted and sent to the provider's address.
