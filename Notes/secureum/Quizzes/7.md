```
[Q1] Based on the comments and code shown in the InSecureumDAO snippet
(A): DAO is meant to be opened only by the admin by making an Ether deposit to the contract
(B): DAO can be opened by anyone by making an Ether deposit to the contract
(C): DAO requires an exact payment of membershipFee to join the DAO
(D): None of the above

[Q2] Based on the code shown in the InSecureumDAO snippet
(A): Guarded launch via circuit breakers has been implemented correctly for all state modifying functions
(B): Zero-address check(s) has/have been implemented correctly
(C): All critical privileged-role functions have events emitted
(D): None of the above

[Q3] Reentrancy protection only on join() (assume it’s correctly specified) indicates that
(A): Only payable functions require this protection because of handling msg.value
(B): join() likely makes untrusted external call(s) but not the other contract functions
(C): Both A and B
(D): Neither A nor B

[Q4] Access control on msg.sender for DAO membership is required in
(A): createVote() to prevent non-members from creating votes
(B): castVote() to prevent non-members from casting votes
(C): getWinningOutcome() to prevent non-members from viewing winning outcomes
(D): None of the above

[Q5] A commit/reveal scheme (a cryptographic primitive that allows one to commit to a chosen value while keeping it hidden from others, with the ability to reveal the committed value later) is relevant for
(A): join() to not disclose msg.sender while joining the DAO
(B): createVote() to not disclose the possible outcomes during creation
(C): castVote() to not disclose the vote being cast
(D): All the above

[Q6] Security concern(s) from missing input validation(s) is/are present in
(A): createVote() for duplicate _voteId
(B): castVote() for existing _voteId
(C): getWinningOutcome() for existing _voteId
(D): setMembershipFee() for sanity/threshold checks on _fee

[Q7] removeAllMembers() function
(A): Will not work as expected to remove all the members from the DAO
(B): Will work as expected to remove all the members from the DAO
(C): Is a critical function missing an event emission
(D): None of the above

[Q8] InSecureumDAO will not be susceptible to something like the 2016 “DAO exploit”
(A): Because it derives from ReentrancyGuard.sol which protects all contract functions by default
(B): Only if it does not have a withdraw Ether function vulnerable to reentrancy and makes no external calls
(C): Because Ethereum protocol was fixed after the DAO exploit to prevent such exploits
(D): Because Solidity language was fixed after the DAO exploit to prevent such exploits
